        <h1>Klaudia Gołębiowska</h1>
        <p>junior frontend developer</p>
        <p>I am an energetic, communicative student of Computer Science in Business with 7 years of experience in projects, events and customer success. I am looking for opportunities where I can improve my hard skills. I completed an 8-month stationary seminar in Python programming at Software Development Academy (including modules from algorithms, databases, frontend and backend), since April I have been attending Frontend training organized by DEVSTYLE and since May - Frontend Programming course organized by home.pl Academy. Till the end of July I will continue working in 3YOURMIND, a company producing software for 3D printing industries, where I took part in application testing, Java Script and databases trainings. 
            I possess references from employers in London, Wroclaw and Berlin.</p>
